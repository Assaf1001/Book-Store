        <b>What is manga?</b> Manga is an umbrella term for a wide variety of
        comic books and graphic novels originally produced and published in
        Japan. Unlike American comic books, which are usually printed in full
        color, Japanese manga is almost always black and white. Full-color
        prints are often only used for special releases. <br />
        <br />
        Japanese manga is read right-to-left rather than left-to-right, which is
        the norm for English language publications. This can take some getting
        used to if you have only ever read English publications as it often
        feels like you’re "reading backwards," but you will hardly notice once
        you’ve practiced enough. <br /> <br /> In Japan, a lot of manga are
        released on a monthly or a weekly chapter-by-chapter basis through manga
        magazines such as Weekly Shōnen Jump, which has been in circulation
        since 1968. If a series is popular enough, its chapters are then
        collected and published into volumes called tankōbon volumes, which
        usually feature a few chapters of the overall story.

        Most manga series are long-running and can span multiple volumes. This
        is something to keep in mind when starting a new series as it is
        imperative you read the volumes in the correct order. This might be
        easier for small series, such as Naoko Takeuchi's Sailor Moon, which
        only has 12 volumes, versus longer-running series such as Akira
        Toriyama's Dragon Ball, which has 42 volumes.
